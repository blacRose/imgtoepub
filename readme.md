# What will it be?

##This is going to be a program to take a folder of images and make it an epub.

# Looking for contributors...

The big thing is, I really need info about what you implement, or [issues](https://github.com/blacRose/imgtoepub/issues) are preferred...

###Useful small stuff

[argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html) and [argparse docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html)
# Todo:
- specify dir and file name to create
- grab files in dir and put in tmp folder
- create HTML
- make file metadata
- zip dir contents
- create .epub from zip

# Yeah, git is hard... but <3!
